				<p>
					In osu!, beatmaps are created by the community and verified by staff members. 
					There are already more than 100k validated beatmaps. 
					Due to the large and ever increasing amount of beatmaps, evaluating their difficulty can not be done subjectively and has to be automated.
				</p>
				<p>
					For that purpose, as of 2021 and since 2014, the difficulty of beatmaps is evaluated using a traditionnal algorithm (called ppv2) 
					based on the spacial and time distance of consecutive hit-circles and some form of accumulation of the difficulty across a whole beatmap.  
					Based on that, scores are also given a difficulty value which is given in a unit called "pp" standing for "performance points". 
					Each player is assigned a global pp value as a weighted sum (exponentially decreasing weight) of his scores ordered in descending pp values. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Even though the ppv2 algorithm is regularly improved, it is still highly unbalanced as there are a lot of aspects of the real difficulty of beatmap 
					for which no one yet has found a good way of estimating them. 
					This leads to inaccuracy in the ranking of players and tentative of abuse of that inaccuracy from players and beatmap creators.
				</p>
				<p>
					The goal of this project is to find the issues in the osu! score evaluation system by making some visualizations. 
					The first idea is to figure out which skills the players are more likely to improve. 
					The figure below displays three skill (count50, count100 and count300) metrics evaluation.  
					Note that the skills which players tend to improve over time may be considered for the score evaluation.

				<p>
					Next, the beatmaps are studied. 
					To determine the overall tendencies, several beatmap features are visualized in the star chart below.
					In this star chart the average feature levels are compared to the top-1000 most popular beatmaps' ones.
				</p>
